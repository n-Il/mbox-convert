 Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root to a binary tree, =
implement serialize(root), which serializes the
tree into a string, and =
deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into
the tree.

For example, given the following Node class

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=3DNone, right=3DNone):
        self.val =3D val
        self.left =3D left
        self.right =3D right


The following test should pass:

node =3D Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val =3D=3D 'left.left'
