 Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

The edit distance between two strings =
refers to the minimum number of character
insertions, deletions, and =
substitutions required to change one string to the
other. For example, the =
edit distance between =E2=80=9Ckitten=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Csitting=
=E2=80=9D is three:
substitute the =E2=80=9Ck=E2=80=9D for =
=E2=80=9Cs=E2=80=9D, substitute the =E2=80=9Ce=E2=80=9D for =
=E2=80=9Ci=E2=80=9D, and append a =E2=80=9Cg=E2=80=9D.

Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.
